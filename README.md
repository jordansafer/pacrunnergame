# PacRunner
Python 2.7 endless screen Pacman game

To play this game, store both Python files in
the same directory and run the file Pacman.py.

Make sure you are running Python 2.7 and you
should be good to go, since the graphics are
in Tkinter, which is included.

High scores and saved level tiles will be saved
using subdirectories at the location you
saved the main program.
